# TalkingChalks

## The first judgement
Our first delivery was a bit confusionary so we tried to make it more focused and streamlined.

## Changes
> Smart bands motivation is ok, but should be supported by questionnaires

We moved our focus to the most important component of the project: the user.

Our second survey is based on questions about the use of different devices to define better the possible use of the smartband.
In addition we conducted a "research on our competitor" explained in the executive summary.

## Our work up to now
The first prototype of the system has been built: basic connection across the edge board (iot-lab), the gateway (python script) and the cloud (Azure).
Audio playback is simulated printing different string on device terminal.
All this work is documented with two videos directed by James Cameron.

## Executive summary
We conducted a second survey with a precise purpose: understand if and how our idea could be helpful for the visitors of the museum.

To do so we tried to find the strengths of TalkingChalks over the "competitors"and its weaknesses that need to be eliminated.

One of the key points we retrieved from the survey is the fact that most of the users would love to have a personalized description of the museum according to differents informations level: TalkingChalks is here for this!


## Future-Features and Evaluations
We noticed that our project lacked interactivity so we decided to make visitors part of the museum's art. Using visitor's interactions with the statues we plan to create a digital modern art paiting. Stay tuned.

Leat, but not last, we plan to evaluate in detail the cost of the whole system in terms of hardware and connections prices.
