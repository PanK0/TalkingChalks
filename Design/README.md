# Design
Many years have passed since the founding of the first museum and things must change sooner or later! The types of visitors have increased and now not only art lovers cross the threshold of museums, they are sometimes even forced! Our aim is to make the visit to the museum more attractive in order to entertain even the most lively child disrespectful of classical culture (or at least for his teacher).
