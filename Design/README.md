# Design
Many years have passed since the founding of the first museum and things must change sooner or later! The types of visitors have increased and now not only art lovers cross the threshold of museums, they are sometimes even forced! Our aim is to make the visit to the museum more attractive in order to entertain even the most lively child disrespectful of classical culture (or at least for his teacher).

## PERSONAS

## STORYBOARD 
Here a short visual explaination on how the final user will interact with our service.
Each visitor will have a smartband equipped with a sensor related to his visitor category (see personas).
Approaching the band to the sensor reader that each statue (the most important) will have, an audio description of it will be issued from a speaker, adapted to the type of visitor.

Note: NFC sensor has only an illustrative purpose and may change during development.
