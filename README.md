# TalkingChalks
TalkingChalks is an IoT system that can be used in a museum with a twofold purpose. The first is to help visitors during the tour providing information about the museum, the statues and the story behind them. The second is to keep children focused on the tour with an interactive game and a prize for the first classified (*this is only a suggestion to make the game more entertaining, we haven't discussed with Sapienza Store or the museum management to see if this is actuable*).
