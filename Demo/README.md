# General Behaviour
The Gateway starts and loads all the registered devices attached to statues.

Lora nodes send a JSON string like the following one
`{'dev_id' : 'dev_00', 'profile_id' : 'Hugo', 'temp' : '36', 'hrate' : '72', 'timestamp' : '123'}`

The Gateway receives the message and looks for the existance of the device.

If the device is found, then the Gateway assigns the requested profile to it and data are forwarded to the hub and to the database. 

Data are forwarded to the cloud.

Each message that the gateway receives contributes to create the abstract painting, generating a circle with the color of the profile and the dimension of the heart rate.

## Requirements
- [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)
- [IOT-LAB](https://www.iot-lab.info) account
- TheThingsNetwork ([TTN](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org)) account
- [RIOT OS](https://riot-os.org/)
- [Gateway file](https://github.com/PanK0/TalkingChalks/tree/master/Demo/Gateway) knowledge
- [LoRa file](https://github.com/PanK0/TalkingChalks/tree/master/Demo/LoRa) knowledge
- azure-iot-device [Python module]

***
## How To test

### Gateway
- Run the `Gateway.py` giving `python Gateway.py` on your local machine

### LoRa
On [IOT-LAB](https://www.iot-lab.info) follow [this tutorial](https://www.iot-lab.info/tutorials/riot-ttn/) with some exceptions:
- at point (2), when you submit the experiment, change -l 1 with -l 3 in order to reserve two lorawan boards
- at point (4), after cloning RIOT, copy the file [main.c](https://github.com/PanK0/TalkingChalks/blob/master/Demo/LoRa/main.c) in the RIOT/tests/pkg_semtech-loramac folder
- at point (7) execute the command once per board
- at point (8) do the operations per each board
- instead of following point (10) just give the command `loramac set dev_id`, where `dev_id` is the ID of the device you have choosen between `dev_00`, `dev_01`, `dev_02`
- instead of following point (12) just give the command `loramac start`

## Output
The output should be like:

And this is a kind of the message arriving to the cloud:

[Here](https://youtu.be/xRKr4TnVqlI) is the tech demo.

## End User product [Draft]
[Here](https://youtu.be/Zwez2I6sRho) you can find a short video of how an user should see the system.

Here the LoRa Board is graphically simulated by a smartphone and two smartbands are simulated by two distinct NFC tags. 
The statue is simulated by an action figure of the famous pok√®mon Squirtle. 
In the video it is possible to see that, when the user passes his smartband [NFC tag] next to the board [Smartphone], the corresponding audio guide is activated. Audio guides are different because the two simulated users have choosen different profiles.

From these two different simulations we can see that as soon as the NFC tag is passed next to the board, the system is activated and all the data are immediately stored into the database.

## Directory Example and specifications
Here is an example on how the directory tree can be:

[![dirtree.png](https://i.postimg.cc/jj5jTsHZ/dirtree.png)](https://postimg.cc/MnCwbJrQ)

You can find the `main.c` file in the [/LoRa](https://github.com/PanK0/TalkingChalks/tree/master/Demo/LoRa) folder.

You can find the `Gateway.py` and the `devices.txt` file in the [/Gateway](https://github.com/PanK0/TalkingChalks/tree/master/Demo/Gateway) folder.
