# TalkingChalks

## The second judgement

Professors liked the fact that we defended our work, but they think we didn't exploit much about iot.

We decided to add functionalities to the smartband collecting also the heart rate of the person who wears it. It can be used as an indicator to understand if he liked the artwork or not (more below).

Moreover the scalability we have planned will let to implement more smart features as you can see in the specific section.

## Changes
* Visitor's painting completed.
* Detailed cost evaluation of the prototype. 
* New functionality! Heart reate sensing.

## Our work up to now
We finally built a working prototype of the whole system that you can see [here](https://google.it): again audio playback is simulated with "on-screen"text, but now we managed to push visitor's data to the database and figured out how to really do crowdsensing with them.

As exposed in previus delivery we noticed that our project lacked interactivity so we decided to make visitors part of the museum's art. A new abstract painting is generated everyday by the users while activating the sensors with the smartbands.

Moreover, smartband now has the ability to read heart rate of the visitor. The heart rate pick of the last few seconds will be sent to the gateway when the NFC tag of a statue is scanned and this will help curators to understand if the statue is appreciated or not. This idea is validated thanks to [this](https://mapping-museum-experience.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Physiological-Correlates.pdf) paper. In addition heart rate is also used to give different sizes to the visitor's "personal" painting circles.

We have made a cost evaulation so that the museum curators know more about TalkingChalks and its costs. We have decided to estimate the cost per unit, so that the curators of each museum can decide where to place each unit. It's strongly recommended to not to place sensors on each statue, because the speakers of a statue can interpose with the ones of another statue.

## Possible Future Implementations
The keypoint of our project as explained multiple times is the scalability: smartband can be used for multiple purposes thanks to its easyness of use. Thanks to this we think that a new "future-feature" could be the possibility to let the band vibrate when the visitors are too close to the statue (safety of the object) or too close to each others (safety for the person). 

Moreover, many others visitor's profile can be implemented to diversify more the journey into the museum.
