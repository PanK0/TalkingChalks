## The second judgement

Professors liked the fact that we defended our work, but they think we didn't exploit much about iot.

We decided to add functionalities to the smartband collecting also the heart rate of the person who wears it. It can be used as an indicator to understand if he liked the artwork or not, like explained in [this](https://mapping-museum-experience.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Physiological-Correlates.pdf) paper.

## Changes
New functionality included! We noticed that our project lacked interactivity so we decided to make visitors part of the museum's art. A new abstract painting is generated everyday by the users while activating the sensors with the smartbands.

We have also added a detailed cost evaluation of the prototype.
