## The second judgement
Professors liked the fact that we defended our work, but they think we don't exploit the use of a smartband.

We decided to exploit the functionalities of the smartband collecting also the heart rate of the person who wears it. It can be used as an indicator to understand if he liked the artwork or not, like explained in [this](https://mapping-museum-experience.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Physiological-Correlates.pdf) paper.

## Changes
New functionality included! A new abstract painting is generated everyday by the users activating the sensors with the smartbands.
We have also added a detailed cost evaluation of the prototype. 

## Future-Features and Evaluations
