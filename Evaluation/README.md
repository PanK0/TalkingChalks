## Survey
We have carried out a survey to analyse the habits of museum visitors and divide them in different categories. Many people answered to the [Italian version](https://forms.gle/jZ4fBaXa6VDhBdABA), but there is also an [English one]().
<br>The results of the survey shows that TalkingChalks would be widely accepted by people, because they prefer audio guides and not being limited when visiting a museum. For the interactive part for children we haven't get any feedback, but we think that it would be a good idea to have fun learning new things.
<br/>In total 131 people completed our form, 95,4% of them aged from 19 to 65. Unfortunately we had few answers from elder people, in which we were interested to, and zero answers from children (less than 14 years old), the users of our interactive application. 
<br>Luckily we have received many answers by adults who take children to exhibitions and although taking children to museum is easy, is quite difficult keep the focus on the visit and (sometimes) provide information to the children. In this optic, TalkingChalks would be very useful because it can give children the right information and keep them focused on the tour with an interactive game.
<br>Survey results show that the majority of people use audio guides and even in this case TalkingChalks can be a good option because it is based on audio description. The difference with the typical audio guide is that our audio description will be different for every typology of visiors.
<br>Only 4,5% of people didn't like our idea of a personalized tour, they think that audio guide is already sufficient and they prefer visit the museum alone. Since TalkingChalks consists of a personalized audio guide, we can take these results as positive.

## FAQ
#### What is TalkingChalks?
TalkingChalks is an IoT system that can be used in a museum with a twofold purpose. The first is to help visitors during the tour providing information about the museum, the statues and the story behind them. The second is to keep children focused on the tour with an interactive game and a prize for the first classified (*this is only a suggestion to make the game more entertaining, we haven't discussed with Sapienza Store or the museum management to see if this is actuable.*).
#### How does it work?
TalkingChalks works with special bracelets. They can activate sensors placed in specific points and an audio description of the statue will be played out loud. The audio description changes according to the typology of the bracelet that is activating it. The sensors are activated by bracelets and not by people in proximity because the museum is a noisy environment full of students who study and have classes. Moreover counting how many times sensors have been activated by the bracelets, we can have an overview on the most visited statues of the collection.
#### Why is TalkingChalks different?
TalkingChalks’ innovation is that the tour is more interactive and fun, especially for children. Plus, students from classical studies and from theatre courses could contribute to our project providing the correct information in the best way. 

#### Does it answer the needs of the user?
TalkingChalks uses different bracelets to meet everyone’s needs. There is a bracelet for people passionate about arts so that they can have detailed descriptions, a bracelet for people who are not really interested and want to know the basic information. There is also a bracelet for teachers or parents who are visiting the museum with children, so that they can have information in a simplified way. Finally there is a bracelet with buttons on it, so that children can play and answer questions.

#### Why a bracelet? 
TaklingChalks works with a bracelet so that everyone can use it. It is mainly thought for children and elder people, which don’t usually have smartphones or an internet connection. 
#### What is the prize? 
The prize can be something from Sapienza store, like a reusable Sapienza bottle. In this case the important thing is not the prize itself, but keeping the children focused on the tour. *This is only a suggestion to make the game more entertaining, we haven't discussed with Sapienza Store or the museum management to see if this is actuable.*
