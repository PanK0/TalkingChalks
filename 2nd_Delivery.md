# 2<sup>nd</sup> Delivery Recap

## The first judgement
Our first delivery was a bit confusionary so we tried to make it more focused and streamlined.

## Changes
We moved our focus to the most important component of the project: the user.
Our second survey is based on questions about visitor's attitude with wearables to define better the possible use of the smartband.

In addition we conducted a "research on our competitor" explained in the following table.

| Service | Fast | Cheap | Clear | Personalized |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `TalkingChalks` |✅|✅|✅|✅
| `Audio Guide` |✅| |✅|
| `Museum Guide` |✅| |✅|
| `Internet` | |✅|


## Our work up to now
The first prototype of the system has been built: basic connection across the edge board (iot-lab), the gateway (python script) and the cloud (Azure).
Audio playback is simulated printing different string on device terminal.

## Future-Features
We noticed that our project lacked interactivity so we decided to make visitors part of the museum's art. Using visitor's interactions with the statues we plan to create a digital modern art paiting. Stay tuned.
