# TalkingChalks Web Application

To guarantee an easy access to the data we provided a simple web interface from which the curators of the museum can visualize the informations received by the devices on the statues.

By connecting to the WebApp it is possible to select a device among those who are sending data and visualize the profiles that visited that statue.

## How To
To run the WebApp download it and give the terminal ommand `npm install`.
Once finished give `npm start` and connect to localhost:3000.

After that you will be able to visualize data coming from the system.

Here is an example on what your view will be:
|  Penelope Statue informations |
|---|
|![app-penelope.png](https://i.postimg.cc/L8rzNW3n/app-penelope.png)|

The picture is clear: TalkingChalks has registered two people with profile Hugo approaching the statue, one with profile Maria and four with profile Ettore (hey, better don't make Odisseus gelous, don't you think so?!?)

By selecting the device on the selector above you can switch between the three registered ones and so you can receive informations about the other devices.

| Odisseus Statue informations  | St. Gennaro Statue informations  |
